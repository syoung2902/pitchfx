# pitchfx
Updating and modifying a mySQL pitchf/x database for use in my thesis, including queries

Begin by downloading the initial database (DB Download)

Next, we need to add our outside data

-PitcherWAR-
We get this from the play index tool on Baseball-Reference's site. I pulled all pitchers for the years 2007-2015 who started at least 20 games, their WAR statistic for each year and their team.

-Retrosheet Data-
Retrosheet data brings in some outside information we need. XXXXXX is the automated batch file that compiles the information with one mouse click. This new table gives us attendance, weather, and some other information.
